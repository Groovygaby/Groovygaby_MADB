      <p class="space"><a class="space"
          href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-67989930"
          target="_blank"><button class="button">Read the full
            story</button></a></p>
      <p class="space">A fake video was circulated depicting a cricket legend, Sachin
      Tendulkar, supposedly promoting an online gaming app as an easy way
      to make money. It also falsely claimed that his daughter had used it
      recently. It has later been found that many Bollywood actresses have
      been targeted in a similar way.</p>
      <p class="space">India’s junior IT minister said they will soon enforce strict rules
      to ensure social media platforms promptly remove deep fake videos.
      Under India's IT rules, social media platforms must ensure that "no
      misinformation is posted by any user" and platforms that do not
      comply could be taken to court under Indian law.</p>
      <p class="space">As celebrities are often aligned with a brand and are revered,
      people have faith and trust in their endorsements, making them ideal
      targets for such schemes. The Wall Street Journal highlighted this
      issue on 5 October 2022 in an article titled “Deepfakes of
      Celebrities Have Begun Appearing in Ads, With or Without Their
      Permission. The article states that this deceptive scheme creates
      videos that use computer-generated renditions to make it look as
      though celebrities have said or done things that they have not. This
      tactic is partly employed to reduce costs. For the celebrity in
      question, it poses a significant challenge to go after each and
      every small business or person who does this to them.</p>
      <p class="space">According to the Hindustan Times, India ranks as the 6th most
      vulnerable country to be targeted in this way with South Korea in
      first place. While many celebrities and high-profile people are
      falsely represented, there are also public figures like Donald Trump
      who have helped create and promote their own fake news.</p>
      <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;</p>
      <p class="space">The classic parental saying “If your friend jumped off a cliff,
      would you?” is very pertinent in this story. Although you may look
      up to celebrities, don’t believe everything you see and hear from
      them. If their content seems sensational, urgent or out of
      character, fact-check it before believing it.</p>
