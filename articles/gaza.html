      <p class="space"><a class="space"
          href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67114313"
          target="_blank"><button class="button">Read the full
            story</button></a></p>
      <p class="space">This article published in October 2023 explores the
        widespread
        dissemination of fake news, conspiracy theories and hateful content
        on social media regarding the Israeli invasion of Gaza. It expands
        on a scary realisation that many of the social media accounts
        spreading hateful content are fake.</p>
      <p class="space">Shocking videos and messages were and still are being
        spread. The
        disinformation in many cases, was not limited to accounts trying to
        undermine violence against hostages. There have been many profiles
        supporting Israel’s actions and sharing misleading and hateful
        content.</p>
      <p class="space">By distorting and confusing things online, it becomes
        harder to get
        the real truth of what is happening if individuals rely solely on
        social media for updates on the crisis. As Marianna Spring who wrote
        the article points out, this can have serious implications for the
        international community when it comes to investigating allegations
        of war crimes, providing aid and accurately understanding the
        developments.</p>
      <img class="image" src="../images/article 5.2.png" alt="">
      <p class="space">Cyabra, an Israel-based social media analytics firm, has
        found that
        approximately 20% of accounts discussing Hamas's attacks are
        fictitious. These accounts may be automated or operated by
        individuals under false pretences.</p>
      <p class="space">Spring offers certain clues that can serve as indicators
        of an
        account’s authenticity. One suggestion is to check whether a
        profiler has recently been created and is rapidly sharing a lot of
        divisive and or conflicting content, this suggests that the account
        is probably inauthentic. However, confirming the falseness of a
        profile and identifying its creators is challenging without
        cooperation from social media platforms, which are often reluctant
        to share such data.</p>
      <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;
      </p>
      <p class="space">It is important to remember that social media should not
        be
        considered a reliable source of information in all cases. News
        publications may not be perfect either, but they tend to be more
        accurate. Countries at war with each other are most likely both
        using social media to spread fake news, making it crucial for you to
        seek alternative sources in order to achieve a clearer understanding
        of the conflict.</p>
