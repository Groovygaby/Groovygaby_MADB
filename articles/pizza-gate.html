      <p class="space">Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing
        with it.</p>
      <p class="space">In 2016, a bizarre fake news story made the headlines in
        Washington aiming to
        discredit the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton. This occurred during
        election time, suggesting an intention to sway public opinion against
        the
        Democrats. Conspiracists came up with a theory called Pizza Gate and
        accused a
        pizzeria linked to the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, of being
        the centre
        of a child sex trafficking ring. This situation escalated when a man who
        was
        misled by these claims, walked into the restaurant with a gun and fired
        it,
        leading to his consequent arrest. The false theory was based on
        Democratic Party
        emails that had been hacked into. The owner of the restaurant was a
        Democratic
        Party donor and was featured in these emails because he was organising a
        Democratic fundraiser. However, when these emails got leaked, people in
        online
        forums started to conspire and suggested innocuous food terms were
        actually
        secret codes for illicit activities.</p>
      <p class="space">Right-wing blogs supported by Donald Trump propagated
        this theory. While their
        intention was clearly aimed at turning voters against the Democratic
        Party, they
        may not have fully realised the potential consequences of spreading such
        false
        information. The armed man who entered the restaurant posed a danger to
        the
        public and could have potentially killed staff and patrons. If
        misinformation
        aligns with an individualâ€™s beliefs or values, it has the ability to
        affect
        their emotions intensely and lead to regrettable decisions. This was
        exemplified
        by Edgar Welch, the man arrested, whose actions were driven by his
        strong
        opposition to child pornography and paedophilia which led him to take
        drastic
        measures based on the false claims.</p>
      <img class="image" src="..//images/article 1.2.png" alt="">
      <p class="space">Research from Syracuse University supports the idea that
        deeply held beliefs,
        when echoed by misinformation, can motivate individuals to act in ways
        that are
        extremely detrimental. A salacious and disturbing topic such as child
        pornography was bound to attract people's attention and provoke extreme
        reactions, the creators of this news were well aware of this fact. Fake
        news is
        often inflammatory and sensational, dragging people in under a false
        pretence in
        order to garner attention and discussion. However, in this instance, it
        went
        well beyond discussion, human lives were at risk, and this shows how
        dangerous
        spreading fake news can be.</p>

        <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;
        </p>
        <p class="space">Critical thinking is essential. Don't let sensational headlines influence you
        without digging deeper for the truth. Fake news not only distorts reality but
        can also incite dangerous situations as displayed above.</p>
