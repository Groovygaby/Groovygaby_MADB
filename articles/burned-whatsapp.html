      <p class="space">On 29 August 2018 Ricardo, a 21-year-old student, and his
        uncle, a
        43-year-old farmer, were burnt to death by an angry mob because of a
        rumour that was circulated on WhatsApp claiming that they were child
        abductors. Ricardo and his uncle went to the town centre on 29
        August to buy construction supplies and were mistakenly accosted by
        locals. This led to their subsequent arrest by the police under the
        pretence of the two men ‘disturbing the peace’. Meanwhile, a
        WhatsApp message falsely warning of child kidnappers spread panic in
        the community. Influenced by these rumours, a mob gathered outside
        the police station. Despite police assurances that the men were not
        kidnappers, the situation escalated due to misinformation spread via
        WhatsApp and Facebook. Francisco Martinez, known as "El Tecuanito",
        live-streamed the event on Facebook, further inciting the crowd.
        Another man identified as Manuel, rang town hall bells to signal the
        supposed release of the two men and Petronilo Castelan, known as "El
        Paisa", urged the crowd to buy petrol to set them on fire. The mob
        eventually overran the police station, beat the two men and set them
        ablaze. Ricardo likely died from the beating, while Alberto was
        still alive when set on fire. All three of these men were later
        charged with murder.</p>
      <p class="space">You might be wondering why and how things escalated so
        quickly and
        ended in such a catastrophe. In countries like Mexico and India,
        WhatsApp allows messages to be sent to very large groups. The app's
        end-to-end encryption further adds to the challenge of tracing the
        origin of any shared content. Despite WhatsApp's claim to limit
        groups to twenty people, a Washington Post article from 23 July
        2018, revealed that groups supposedly capped at six members were
        reaching sizes of up to 256 people. The article also highlighted
        that in countries like India and other less affluent nations, many
        users lack digital literacy skills. This lack of experience makes
        manipulating public opinion with false information easier for
        political parties and others.</p>
      <p class="space">In the April 2019 edition of the International Journal of
        Innovative
        Technology and Exploring Engineering, researchers pinpoint two
        factors that contribute to the widespread dissemination of false
        information. The first factor is the affordability of mobile phones
        and the second factor is the notable decrease in internet data
        costs. Moreover, a common concern revolves around society’s general
        lack of awareness in identifying and dealing with fake news
        messages.</p>
      <img class="image" src="../images/article2.2.png" alt="">
      <p class="space">Aside from the issues mentioned
        above, a significant psychological and social component is also at
        play. This raises questions about why individuals believe in fake
        news and how a group can transform into a crowd and then escalate
        into a mob. (Chadna 2019) states that emotional bonds become
        factors that unite an entire group.</p>
      <p class="space">(Nickerson 2023) discusses how being part of a group can
        lead to
        deindividuation—a state where individuals lose self-awareness. This
        can result in people being less likely to follow restraints and
        inhibitions, making them more susceptible to losing their sense of
        individual identity. Researchers at the University of Leeds have
        found that humans tend to follow a few key figures within a group,
        similar to how sheep or birds behave, especially when there are only
        a small number of well-informed individuals within the crowd (Dyer
        et al. 2008).</p>
      <p class="space">The issue of conformity is also worth considering. People
        often opt
        to follow others instead of engaging in independent thought
        processes as it is more convenient. When individuals who share
        beliefs gather together, like in the Mexico incident, they tend to
        reinforce and strengthen each other’s convictions, resulting in a
        more deeply rooted and resilient collective mindset. This particular
        group discovered a sense of camaraderie, influence and comfort
        through their actions. The root cause of it all can be traced back
        to a WhatsApp message that unfortunately led to the tragic loss of
        two innocent lives.</p>
      <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;
      </p>
      <p class="space">Before letting fear or panic guide your actions, pause
        and evaluate
        the reasons behind your response as well as the credibility of the
        information that triggered such a reaction. By adopting a mindset
        that values making decisions based on evidence and being sceptical
        towards unverified claims, you can play a role in creating a society
        that is better informed and less prone to knee-jerk reactions.</p>
