      <p class="space">In August 2022 Anthony Moyneaux from Times Live reported
        on a
        widespread rumour that spread through a WhatsApp voicenote. This
        rumour claimed that the president of South Africa would be
        reinstating a national alcohol ban. The false claim triggered
        widespread panic buying throughout the nation.</p>
      <p class="space">The government later became aware of this spread of fake
        news and a
        minister in parliament debunked the rumour as unfounded.
        Unfortunately, the damage had been done as many South Africans
        unwilling to risk being caught unprepared, had already rushed to buy
        alcohol in large quantities.</p>
      <p class="space">Lungi Mtshali, who represents the Department of
        Cooperative
        Governance and Traditional Affairs also confirmed to News24 that the
        rumour had no truth behind it. There were speculations that it might
        have been spread for the benefit of the alcohol industry.</p>
      <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;
      </p>
      <p class="space">Before letting fear or panic guide your actions, pause
        and evaluate
        the reasons behind your response as well as the credibility of the
        information that triggered such a reaction. By adopting a mindset
        that values making decisions based on evidence and being sceptical
        towards unverified claims, you can play a role in creating a society
        that is better informed and less prone to knee-jerk reactions.</p>
