      <p class="space"><a class="space"
          href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67687449"
          target="_blank"><button class="button">Read the full
            story</button></a></p>
      <p class="space">In December 2023 an article published by the BBC
        uncovered a
        disinformation campaign that targeted Defense Minister Oleksiy
        Reznikov and his daughter, Anastasiya. The fabricated news falsely
        claimed that Reznikov and his family were involved in purchases,
        including luxury cars and villas abroad which supposedly contributed
        to his removal from office in September. Anastasiya hinted that
        these allegations might have played a role in her father’s dismissal
        although he was also facing accusations of corruption.</p>
      <p class="space">During a vacation, Anastasiya’s husband brought this
        misinformation
        to her attention. It falsely alleged that she had acquired villas in
        Madrid and on the French Riviera; however, upon investigation, it
        was revealed that these properties were actually still for sale and
        had not been purchased by anyone. This tactic of spreading false
        information was not limited to the Reznikovs but was part of a
        broader strategy aimed at various Ukrainian officials.</p>
      <p class="space">BBC Verify traced the origins of the misinformation
        network back to
        Russia. This conclusion was reached based on linguistic errors
        commonly made by Russian speakers as well as the analysed videos
        containing various links to websites associated with Russian
        disinformation efforts pretending to be Western news
        outlets.</p>
      <img class="image" src="../images/article 6.2.png" alt="">
      <p class="space">So, why were they being targeted? A technical research
        manager from
        Stanford Internet Observatory analysed the motives behind these
        targeted disinformation campaigns and suggested that by promoting
        narratives of corruption within Ukraine, the motive was to undermine
        support for Ukraine’s ongoing war effort.</p>
      <p class="space">Moreover, according to an article titled "The Role of
        Social Media
        in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict" written by Najat Al Saied, it is
        suggested that both Russia and Ukraine utilise social media to shape
        public perception to their advantage, capitalising on the platforms'
        ability to echo users' preexisting beliefs. Al Saied argues that the
        inclination towards relying on media for news consumption arises
        from a desire for more autonomy and perceived objectivity.</p>
      <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;
      </p>
      <p class="space">It seems that leaders and high-profile individuals often
        become
        targets for fake news. When politics comes into play, it's important
        to scrutinise the underlying intentions in times of intense
        volatility such as a war.</p>
