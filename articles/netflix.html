        slammed by NHS chief</h1>

      <p class="space"><a class="space"
          href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51312441"
          target="_blank"><button class="button">Read the full
            story</button></a></p>
      <p class="space">In January 2020 the BBC reported on a story about an NHS
        chief
        criticising a wellness brand that was disseminating fake news.
        Gwyneth Paltrow, a well-known actress featured in a Netflix
        documentary called Goop. The documentary focused on her health and
        wellness brand, offering unsolicited recommendations throughout the
        show.</p>
      <p class="space">Simon Stevens, the NHS Chief Executive in England,
        criticised
        Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness brand, Goop, for disseminating false
        health information. He mentions practices performed by them such as
        vampire facials and a body worker who claims to cure mental issues
        by simply moving his hands two inches above a person's
        body.</p>
      <p class="space">Goop also promotes ideas that sunscreen is not good for
        you and
        advocates colonic irrigation, DIY coffee enemas and the use of jade
        and rose quartz eggs for hormonal balance and menstrual cycle
        regulation when used vaginally. Stevens remarked that while fake
        news is often associated with politics, the public's natural concern
        for their health has made Goop an attractive platform for dubious
        health advice from unqualified individuals.</p>
      <p class="space">Consequently, Goop faced legal repercussions from
        California's
        consumer protection office due to these unfounded health claims.
        Zhong (2023) further emphasises that misleading health information
        often confuses the public and contributes to misinformation. While
        Goopâ€™s dubious or fake claims were not posing as severe a threat to
        human life as other fake news stories have, they still have the
        potential to negatively impact individuals by promoting belief in
        unproven and potentially harmful medical practices and
        beliefs.</p>
      <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;
      </p>
      <p class="space">The proof is in the pudding. If you come across a claim
        that seems
        strange or highly unconventional, weigh up the facts first instead
        of blindly believing it. Consider whether the claim is grounded in
        legitimate science or if it falls under pseudoscience, where
        statements and practices may appear effective and factual but lack
        scientific validity.</p>
