      <p class="space">In January 2021, an article by Sima Cotecha from BBC News
        addressed
        the spread of a misleading story via WhatsApp. This story claimed
        that the COVID-19 vaccine contained animal derivatives, which went
        against the dietary and religious principles prevalent in Asian
        communities. Specifically, the consumption of pork is prohibited in
        Islamic communities, while Hinduism regards cows as sacred. This led
        to major vaccine hesitancy among British Asians. Furthermore, the
        misinformation included claims that vaccines could modify a personâ€™s
        DNA.</p>
      <p class="space">There was also a claim in these videos that the
        vaccination could
        alter your DNA. Dr Harpreet Sood, who was at the forefront of the
        NHS's effort to combat misinformation at the time, identified
        language and cultural differences as contributing factors to the
        spread of these falsehoods.</p>
      <p class="space">Dr Harpreet Sood, who was leading an NHS
        anti-disinformation drive
        at the time reckoned that language and cultural barriers were
        playing a part in the false information.</p>
      <p class="space">(Ngai, Singh & Yao 2022) contend that safety concerns
        played a major
        role in insighting this fake new frenzy that took place. The
        deceptive nature of these messages was further magnified by their
        tone and their attempt to mimic genuine news articles and scientific
        reports in terms of format and linguistic style.</p>
      <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;
      </p>
      <p class="space">The spread of fake news can have a major impact on public
        health
        initiatives, particularly when it exploits cultural and religious
        sensitivities. Always verify any health-related information with a
        reputable source before sharing it with friends and family.
        Remember, fake news often uses sensationalism to insight a sense of
        fear in society.</p>
