        two more victims</h1>
      <img class="image" src="../images/article 9.1.png" alt="">
      <p class="space"><a class="space"
          href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-44435127"
          target="_blank"><button class="button">Read the full
            story</button></a></p>
      <p class="space">In June 2018 the BBC reported on a tragic incident that
        occurred
        due to a circulation of misinformed opinions being shared on
        Whatsapp. This story involved the tragic deaths of an audio engineer
        and a digital artist who were mistakenly believed to be child
        kidnappers and were fatally assaulted after stopping to ask for
        directions.</p>
      <p class="space">This false accusation originated from a video that was
        circulated on
        WhatsApp, which turned out to be fabricated and not even produced in
        India. The situation worsened when local media outlets started
        spreading these rumours, lending them unwarranted credibility.
        Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident and officials have
        not yet been able to identify any incidents of child abduction cases
        related to these fake stories and videos.</p>
      <p class="space">The issue of misinformation leading to violence is
        particularly
        severe in India. Annie Gowen, reporting for the Washington Post in
        2018, highlighted the issue of mob violence triggered by baseless
        messages on WhatsApp. She noted that India has a vast number of
        digitally illiterate smartphone users, comprising over 200 million
        people who send billions of messages daily. This makes India
        Whatsapp’s largest market and a hotbed for the rapid spread of fake
        news.</p>
      <p class="space">Nikhil Pahwa, a digital rights activist, suggested that
        in order to
        mitigate this issue, WhatsApp should require messages to display the
        original sender’s number on all forwarded messages. This would help
        with identifying the origins of any potential misinformation. In
        response to these tragedies, Google has launched a programme in
        India designed to train journalists on recognising and debunking
        fake news. This initiative is part of the ongoing endeavour to
        combat the dissemination of fake news in India.</p>
      <p class="space">&#128161;<strong>Lesson of the day:</strong> &#128161;
      </p>
      <p class="space">Be wary of messages that encourage violence in any form.
        Creators of
        fake news often use mob mentality to entice people. Consequently,
        individuality and personal beliefs will be stripped away,
        potentially leading a person to make decisions or take actions that
        are out of character.</p>
