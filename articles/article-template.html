                <p>Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing with it.</br></br>

					In 2016, a bizarre fake news story made the headlines in Washington basically to put the Democratic Party, in particular, Hillary Clinton in a poor light.  This was at a time when elections were taking place so clearly with a motive to sway opinion against the Democrats.  Conspiracists came up with a theory called pizzagate, claiming that the pizzeria was at the base of a child sex ring run by Hillary Clinton.    A man claiming to be investigating this walked into the restaurant with a gun and fired it leading to his arrest.  This theory or fake news was based on Democratic Party emails that had been hacked.  The owner of the restaurant who happened to be a Democratic Party donor was involved in these emails and was organising a Democratic fundraiser.  The two message boards who were involved in the conspiracy reckoned that simple words for food used to make pizzas like cheese, hot dog and pizza were actually codes for young children and sex acts. </br></br>

					Right-wing blogs run by Donald Trump were spreading this theory and although they clearly did this to try and influence voters against the Democratic Party, they may well not have realised the consequences of spreading this fake news.  The armed man walking into the restaurant in question posed a danger to the public and could have potentially killed staff and or patrons.  This misinformation clearly resonated with Edgar Welch the man who was subsequently arrested. It has been researched and found that if misinformation aligns with an individualâ€™s beliefs or values, it will affect their emotions and make them act out.  Edgar Welch clearly felt strongly about child pornography and paedophilia and upon reading this decided to take the law into his own hands.  </br></br>

					A study by Syracuse University in 2021 supports this research, stating that if someone believes something and it resonates with them the beliefs lead to action which can either be positive or negative.  In this instance, it was negative as people's lives were put in danger.</br></br>

					A salacious and disturbing topic such as child pornography was bound to get people's attention and provoke extreme reactions and the creators of this fake news knew that.  Fake news is often inflammatory and that makes it exciting; hence, people will talk about it.  In this instance, it did not stop at just talking and this shows how dangerous spreading fake news can be.  The intent of this news was to deceive people into thinking that the Democratic Party was corrupt and although some fake news may be due to an honest mistake, there was nothing honest about this, it was totally deceptive and untrue.</br></br>
