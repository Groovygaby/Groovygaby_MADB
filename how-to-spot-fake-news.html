      <h1 class="fake-news-content">A Guidebook on How to Spot Fake News:</h1>

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Examine the Source:</h2>
      <p class="space">Look at the website's URL where you're getting your information.
        Mistakes in the
        URL or unusual domain extensions like ".infonet" or ".offer" could be
        red flags.
        If the website is unknown to you, delve into its "About Us" section.</p>

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Investigate the Author:</h2>
      <p class="space">Do some digging to find out if they're reputable. Are they authentic,
        well-regarded, speaking on topics within their expertise and do they
        have a
        bias? Reflect on the potential motivations behind the author's writing.
      </p>

      <img class="image" src="images/spot_fake_news_img1.jpg">

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Consult Additional Sources:</h2>
      <p class="space">Is the story being covered by other trustworthy media outlets? Are
        credible
        references cited in the article? Renowned news organisations adhere to
        strict
        fact-checking standards, so wide coverage is a positive indication.</p>

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Adopt a Skeptical Mindset:</h2>
      <p class="space">Be aware that fake news often aims to elicit strong emotional
        responses.
        Question the purpose behind the story's creation. Is it pushing a
        specific
        viewpoint or trying to lead you to another website?</p>

      <img class="image" src="images/spot_fake_news_img2.jpg">

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Verify the Facts:</h2>
      <p class="space">Legitimate news often includes tons of factual information - data,
        expert
        quotes, etc. A lack of these should raise doubts. Be wary of incorrect
        dates or
        timelines and check the publication date to ensure relevance.</p>

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Review the Comments Section:</h2>
      <p class="space">Even genuine articles can have misleading comments underneath. Watch
        out for
        comments or links that might be generated by bots or people spreading
        confusion.</p>

      <img class="image" src="images/spot_fake_news_img3.jpg">

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Reflect on Personal Biases:</h2>
      <p class="space">Recognise your biases. Could they be affecting your interpretation of
        the news?
        Social media algorithms tend to reinforce our preexisting beliefs or
        interests,
        but exposure to varied sources can help in forming balanced views.</p>

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Distinguish Satire from Serious Content:
      </h2>
      <p class="space">With the popularity of satirical websites, it can sometimes be hard to
        tell if a
        story is meant to be humorous. Verify whether the site is known for
        satire or
        humorous content.</p>

      <img class="image" src="images/spot_fake_news_img4.jpg">

      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Assess Image Authenticity:</h2>
      <p class="space">Manipulated images are common on social media. Look for signs of
        editing like
        unnatural warping or inconsistencies in lighting. Utilise tools like
        Google
        Reverse Image Search to trace an image's origin and check for
        alterations.</p>


      <h2 class="fake-news-content">Consult Fact-Checking Websites:</h2>
      <p class="space">Some reputable fact-checking sites include PolitiFact, Fact Check and
        BBC
        Reality Check. These can be invaluable resources for verifying
        information.</p>
